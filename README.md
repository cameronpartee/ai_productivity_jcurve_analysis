I was curious if AI actually increases productivity, or if we're all just busy fixing its mistakes. 🤔 🧠 

To find out, I aggregated data to audit the 'AI ROI' curve; here is what the data actually shows: ⬇️ 

- Integrating AI results in a 1.3% productivity dip for novice users. This occurs because the time saved is initially offset by the "rework loop," where users must manually verify AI accuracy and correct hallucinations. 📉 
 
- Significant proficiency gains usually materialize around 2 to 4 months of consistent use. At this stage, users move past the error-prone phase and hit a "breakout" point. 📈 

- For top-tier performers, AI may provide negligible minutes reduced per task. Because they operate at or close to peak efficiency, AI cannot supplement their existing knowledge and often results in a marginal productivity drag rather than a gain. ⏱️
